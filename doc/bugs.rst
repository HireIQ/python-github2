Reporting bugs
==============

If you think you've found a bug, or inconsistency, in ``python-github`` please
`report an issue`_.

.. note::
   Please don't report bugs via email, this limits who can work on a bug or
   suggest solutions to a bug.  It also makes it impossible for other users to
   search the database of known bugs, which can often lead to duplicated
   effort.

We also use the issue tracker to track feature requests and ideas.  Having all
this information in a single place makes it easier for new contributors to jump
in.

Anatomy of a good bug report
----------------------------

Filing a good report makes it easier to fix bugs, and making it easier to work
on your bug means it is likely to be fixed much faster!

A good bug report will have the following:

* A descriptive title
* A full Python traceback of the error, if there is one
* A minimal test-case to reproduce the error
* A list of solutions you've already tried

Simon Tatham has an excellent essay titled `How to Report Bugs Effectively`_,
with some excellent tips on filing good bug reports.
