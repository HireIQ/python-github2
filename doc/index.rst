``github2`` - Github API v2 library for Python
==============================================

.. warning::

   GitHub are planning to `switch off API v2`_ on 2012-05-01, you should
   be looking to replace ``github2`` as soon as possible.

   Both remoteobjects_ and micromodels_ provide easy-to-use functionality for
   creating bindings to remote APIs, and should significantly reduce the amount
   of work needed in moving away from GitHub's API v2.

This is a Python library implementing all of the features available in version 2
of the `Github API`_.

You should read the developer documentation for the `Github API`_ first.
